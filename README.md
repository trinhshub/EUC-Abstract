**My First TRB Paper: Integrating Economic and Utility Concepts for A Comprehensive Bridge Valuation Model**

*Abstract

Bridge is an important branch of transportation infrastructure asset as the bridge network connects and impacts many other industries in the U.S., which is significant to the nationâ€™s economy and safety of traveling public. As of 2016, thirty-nine percent of bridges in the U.S. were over 50 years or older, and 9.1 percent of bridges were designated structurally deficient. Therefore, public agencies need better practice in managing and maintaining their bridge network. This requires an in-depth bridge valuation process. However, existing valuation approaches are mostly based on physical condition and neglect the effect of factors such as functionality and overall economic value of a bridge. This paper presents an integrated bridge asset valuation methodology that incorporates both economic value and utility theory concept. Various factors featuring the bridge asset value are characterized and considered in the model including physical condition, functionality, direct time-savings, and so on. These factors are categorized into economic value and utility value and are quantified with specific performance measures. The applicability of the proposed methodology is demonstrated through a case study using four real-world bridges in Austin, Texas.  The results show that the integrated comprehensive model is able to evaluate the overall asset value of a bridge, which can assist public agencies to better understand bridge asset value and make more informed decisions in bridge management practice.
