**Abstract**

Existing bridge valuation approaches mostly focus on the construction cost while neglect other values of bridge coming from its functionality, utilization and economic values. Such limitations can prevent public agencies from capturing the true value of their bridges in order to make informed management decisions. The objective this paper is to develop a comprehensive bridge asset valuation methodology that incorporates both economic value and utility theory concept. Various factors featuring the bridge asset value are characterized and considered in the model including physical condition, safety, mobility, AADT, direct time-savings, and so on. These factors are categorized into economic value and utility-based value and quantified with specific performance measures. The applicability of the proposed methodology is demonstrated through a case study using four real-world bridges in Austin, Texas.  The results show that the integrated, comprehensive model is able to effectively evaluate the overall asset value of a bridge. Finally, the paper discusses how public agencies can utilize the evaluation results to better understand bridge asset value and make more informed decisions in bridge management practice.
